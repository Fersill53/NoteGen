## Installation
To install this project vs code or other programs similar is required to run the code. node needs to have been installed. Other required packages such as fs and inquirer are also needed but can be installed through the command line.

## Usage
This project is primarily intended to be used to help create a high-quality note app allowing users to enter and delete notes and open it up in another tab in your favorite browser.

## Contributing
This project had front end starter code provided and additional help from a youtube video helping me to try and correct the note-taking app but am still unable to make it work.

## Tests
In order to test node index.js must be typed into the command line or terminal in order to start the user prompts to generate the custom notes. The provided server information will allow you to open up the website.
